In this project, I've used Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to dive deep into Diwali sales data. Here's a snapshot of what I've uncovered:

🚻 Gender Insights: Women seem to be more enthusiastic shoppers, and they're willing to spend more than men.

🎂 Age Group Analysis: Women between the ages of 26-35 are making the highest purchases.

🏠 State-wise Discoveries: Most orders and sales come from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.

💍 Marital Status Matters: Married women tend to make more significant purchases compared to men.

💼 Occupation Impact: People working in the IT sector tend to spend more.

🍔 Product Category Preferences: While clothing sees the most orders, food items are where customers spend the most.

🏆 Top 10 Products: We've identified the top 10 most sold products.
